This directory contains various handy scripts.

The scripts with capaitalized names correespond exactly to the problem
families described in the paper. all runs all of them.

Typical usage is, eg, "TSP ho k ks ni". This will produce ho.TSP,
k.TSP, ks.TSP, and ni.TSP in the results directory.

Several environment variables can be used to change the behavior:
cutdir		results are put in ${cutdir}/results
cutnumseeds	number of different seeds to give to generator
cutnumrandseeds number of different seeds to give to cut algorithm

summary and capsum are scripts for looking at the output. They take
multiple results files and make a table of total times or cut
capacities, respectively.
